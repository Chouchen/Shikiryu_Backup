## :package: Installation

### First check if you have composer installed

Before installing this, you need to check if you have `PHP`and `Composer` installed on your computer.

### Then install this script

```sh
composer require shikiryu/backup
```

## :rocket: Usage

Everything in this library is based on a scenario (or multiple scenarii).

It consists of 2 sections in a JSON file : 
 * what to backup
 * where to backup
 
You have an example file in `app/scenario`.

The first section is `backup` (what to backup) and the second `transport`

More information about [how to use scenario](docs/using-scenario.md)


### Tips

Each possible section has docs in [their respective folders](docs/configuration)

Here is an example code 

```php
<?php

include_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

try {
    \Shikiryu\Backup\Scenario::launch('backup.json'); // whatever the file name you gave previously
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```
